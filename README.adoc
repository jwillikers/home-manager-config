[TIP]
====
If for any reason the build fails or your computer locks up, there's a good chance that it's related to Nix attempting to build too many jobs simultaneously or not having adequate RAM space to hold the build directory for a package.
These issues can be fixed with configuration options for the Nix daemon in `/etc/nix/nix.conf`.
Use the `max-jobs` option to limit the number of simultaneous jobs.
To build only a single job at a time, this would look like `max-jobs = 1` in the config file.

To prevent running out space in RAM, set the `build-dir` option to a path that is located on disk.
The default `tmp` directory is usually stored in a special filesystem backed by RAM.
To set this to `/var/tmp/nix-daemon`, the line in the config will look like `build-dir = /var/tmp/nix-daemon`.
Be sure to create this directory.

[,sh]
----
sudo mkdir --parents /var/tmp/nix-daemon
----

To apply changes in `/etc/nix/nix.conf`, restart the Nix daemon.

[,sh]
----
sudo systemctl restart nix-daemon.service
----

[TIP]
====
If the DeACSM fails during installation, it's necessary to manually delete the plugin and then redeploy the config and re-import your key in Calibre.
The following command will delete the plugin.

[,sh]
----
rm ~/.config/calibre/plugins/ACSM\ Input.zip ~/.config/calibre/plugins/deacsm.json
----
====
--

. Log out and back in for certain environment variable changes to take effect.
